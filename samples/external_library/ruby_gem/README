The absolute belt and brace way to use external ruby libraries ie gems:

1. Install ruby-processing using jruby
   jruby -S gem install ruby-processing (or from a local gem currently)
2. Install required library the same way
3. "require" the library in your sketch
4. Run ruby-processing starting from jruby
   jruby -S rp5 run --jruby sketch.rb

See worked perlin_noise in this folder 
NB: library will need to work with jruby this excludes most native libraries
but pure ruby libraries should be fine
