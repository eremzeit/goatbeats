Minitest
========

OK strictly the tests should directly test objects, rather than the indirect tests on io here. How to do that I'm not sure so I'm sticking with current tests. There seems to be some problem with how the built in minitest run so I've specified gem "minitest" (if you need to you can probably comment out that line, rather than install an external minitest gem (you will probably get some warning which you can probably ignore, someone is trying to be too clever I suspect).
